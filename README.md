What is VR MAME?
=============
VR MAME is a fork of MAME that add openvr and nvidia physx to emulate real machine

How to compile?
===============

You'll need:

1. vs2015, since It's works only with d3d9 with 11, so I take vs2015 and msbuild as main IDE and compiler.

2. fbx sdk, set enviroment value ADSK_FBX_SDK_2017 to installed path

3. access authority of nvidia gamework(https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworks-physx-overview)
